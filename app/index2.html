            Ear Talk is an online platform for collaborative near-real time distributed music making. By taking musical material and direction from all participants, not just trained composers, earTalk aims to diversity and encourage participation in the new music community. Participants take part in this conversation via an interactive score where they can drag and drop musical components, controlling parameters such as volume, pan, and distortion as they do so.

            As this website is always live, it is intended to exist as continuous live improvisation sound installation.
